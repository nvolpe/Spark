all other demo#.js files run separately and only require cityiq.js and cityCredentials.js



Details about api-starter-code:

demo#.js is where modifications should be made.
Input your own credentials to credentials.js and make appropriate modifications to the demo#.js files' city variable.

Please note, the simulated data makes all predix-zone-ids available to you, however some cities may restrict what access and therefore zones you have.

Cities may vary their predix-zone-ids therefore modify the zone-id variables as needed within the demo#.js code. Also note the urls available to you may not be complete with the corect endings following predix.io, please compare them with the simulated data urls to ensure functionality
