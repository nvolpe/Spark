# Spark
Best parking app ever.


# iOS
Wrote a native iOS sample app to demo my competencies in mobile development.

# Python

I Harvested ALL the parking zones defined by the GE Sensor data API. I used postman to get the json collection. And then I wrote a python script to convert the coordinates to a geojson feature set. I used the output from that script to view the data in a map viewer.
